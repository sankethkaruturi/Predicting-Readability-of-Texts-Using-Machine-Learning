# Predicting-Readability-of-Texts-Using-Machine-Learning
ðŸ“š The objective of this project is to predict the difficulty level of a given text by applying various machine learning techniques. By analyzing features such as vocabulary complexity, sentence structure, and readability metrics, the models aim to accurately classify texts based on their reading difficulty.
